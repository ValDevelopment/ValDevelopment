### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Vladislav Fedorov

I am an aspiring Game Developer and an up-and-coming Data Scientist. I specialize in Unity and C#, but I am also proficient with R, Python, and SQL.

Gamedev is my passion and a field where most of my projects lie, while Data Science is my desired career path and the subject of my studies. 

Speaking of my studies, I have acquired a Bachelor of Science in Statistics degree at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I am also planning on continuing my education at a Master's level.

As for my projects, you can find some of them below.
