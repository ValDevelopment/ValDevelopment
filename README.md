### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Vladislav Fedorov

I am a Data Analyst and a Game Developer. 

I acquired a Bachelor of Science in Statistics degree at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and I am currently enrolled in a Master's program in Statistics and Analytics.

I specialize in R, Python, and SQL, but I also work with Unity and C# for Game Development.

You can find some of my projects below.

## ðŸ“Š Statistics/Data Science Projects

### R Shiny Application

#### This was a final project for a Data Management class at my university. It involved reading the data on musical charts, manipulating, and analyzing it to later use it in a Shiny Application.
#### The application itself was used for displaying the filtered and manipulated data based on user input (artist or year, for example).

### Predicting Tweet Locations: A Machine Learning Approach to Text Analysis

#### Team: Ramanan Srirajan, Bochuan Zhang, Vladislav Fedorov
#### In this group project for a Machine Learning class, I worked on predicting tweet locations using Random Forests. My focus was on handling high-dimensional text data with TF-IDF, mitigating class imbalance, and integrating sentiment analysis and clustering to improve predictions. We also looked into BiLSTM for sequential text patterns and Logistic Regression as a baseline.
