### Hi there 👋 My name is Vladislav Fedorov

I am a Statistician and Game Developer with a strong focus on applied data analysis, machine learning, and interactive tools.

I have a Bachelor of Science in Statistics degree from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Statistics and Analytics at the same university.

I specialize in R, Python, and SQL, but I also work with Unity and C# for game development.

I enjoy building end-to-end projects, from data preparation and modeling to interactive tools and video games.

You can find some of my projects below.

## 📊 Statistics/Data Science Projects

### Counter-Strike Team Analysis Tool

#### Analyzed CS:GO match and team-level data to study economy-driven decision-making across rounds.
#### Merged and transformed match datasets to track transitions between eco, force, and full-buy rounds, and visualized their relationship to round outcomes using interactive plots.

### Indie Publisher Recommendation Tool

#### Developed a content-based recommender system to help indie developers identify potential publishers based on historical catalog similarity.
#### Matched game concepts—defined by Steam tags and target price point—to publishers with comparable releases, and surfaces concrete examples to support discovery and outreach.

### Text-Based Geographic Region Classification Tool

#### Team: Ramanan Srirajan, Bochuan Zhang, Vladislav Fedorov
#### Built text-based classification models to predict the geographic region of tweets using high-dimensional textual features. I focused on TF-IDF representations, class imbalance mitigation, and random forest modeling to improve predictive performance.
#### The broader project also explored logistic regression baselines and BiLSTM models for sequential text patterns, implemented by other team members.

### Interactive Music Chart Trend Analysis Dashboard

#### Cleaned, transformed, and analyzed historical music chart data to power an interactive Shiny dashboard.
#### The application allows users to explore chart trends by artist and year, enabling dynamic filtering and visualization of ranking patterns over time.

## 🎮 Gamedev Projects

<!--
### The Last Spellwright
#### A personal long-term project: a 2D roguelike deck-builder built around spell composition. Cards modify a spell state by adding elemental components rather than resolving fixed effects.

Core mechanics:
- Elemental cards contribute to a spell state that is resolved on cast
  - Spells can either resolve as the sum of their components, combining elemental effects with optional Shape and Style modifiers, or as specific spells with strict composition requirements and higher payoff
- Combat emphasizes knowledge and mana efficiency
- Elemental levels scale dynamically with deck composition and provide passive power increases
- Increasing deck size trades spellcasting consistency for broader access to power
