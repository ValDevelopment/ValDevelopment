### Hi there 👋 My name is Vladislav Fedorov.

I am an aspiring Game Developer and an up-and-coming Data Scientist. 

Gamedev is my passion and a field where most of my projects lie, while Data Science is my desired career path and the subject of my studies. 

Speaking of my studies, I have acquired a Bachelor of Science in Statistics degree at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I am also planning on continuing my education at a Master's level.
