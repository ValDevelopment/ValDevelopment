### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Vladislav Fedorov

I am a Game Developer and a Data Analyst. I specialize in Unity and C#, but I am also proficient with R, Python, and SQL.

Gamedev is my passion and a field where most of my projects lie, while Data Science is my desired career path and the subject of my studies. 

Speaking of my studies, I have acquired a Bachelor of Science in Statistics degree at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I am also planning on continuing my education at a Master's level.

As for my projects, you can find some of them below.

## ðŸ“Š Statistics/Data Science Projects

### R Shiny Application

#### This was a final project for a Data Management class at my university. It involved reading the data on musical charts, manipulating, and analyzing it to later use it in a Shiny Application.
#### The application itself was used for displaying the filtered and manipulated data based on user input (artist or year, for example).
