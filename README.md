### Hi there 👋 My name is Vladislav Fedorov

I am a Data Analyst and a Game Developer. 

I have a Bachelor of Science in Statistics degree from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Statistics and Analytics.

I specialize in R, Python, and SQL, but I also work with Unity and C# for Game Development.

You can find some of my projects below.

## 📊 Statistics/Data Science Projects

### Interactive Music Chart Trend Analysis Dashboard

#### This was a final project for a Data Management class at my university. It involved reading the data on musical charts, manipulating, and analyzing it to later use it in a Shiny Application.
#### The application itself was used for displaying the filtered and manipulated data based on user input (artist or year, for example).

### Text-Based Geographic Region Classification Tool

#### Team: Ramanan Srirajan, Bochuan Zhang, Vladislav Fedorov
#### In this group project for a Machine Learning class, I worked on predicting tweet locations using Random Forests. My focus was on handling high-dimensional text data with TF-IDF, mitigating class imbalance, and integrating sentiment analysis and clustering to improve predictions. We also looked into BiLSTM for sequential text patterns and Logistic Regression as a baseline.

### Counter Strike Team Analysis Tool

#### This project focuses on analyzing CS:GO match and team data to study economy-based trends. It involved manipulating and merging datasets and analyzing team transitions between eco, force, and full-buy rounds, while also studying their win rates for each investment type. The analysis includes match-level and team-level trends with visualizations showcasing round-by-round decisions in individual matches.

### Indie Publisher Recommendation Tool

#### An interactive, content-based recommender system designed to help indie developers discover potential game publishers based on historical catalog similarity. The tool matches a game concept—defined by Steam tags and a target price point—to publishers that have released similar games in the past, and provides concrete examples to support exploration and outreach decisions.
